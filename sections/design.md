Design

After a significant amount of investigation into the traditional
Applicative[^1] style of FRP, I decided to follow the arrow approach
for my own implementation.  Indeed, credence has been lent to the
arrow-based approach by both Hudak\cite{arrowsRobots} and
Elliott\cite{elliottMealy}.

[^1]: Traditional FRP uses applicative functors in no small
measure\cite{applicatives}\cite{pushPull}.
