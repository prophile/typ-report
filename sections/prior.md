Prior Work
==========

There are previous widely-used implementations in Haskell, some of which I will
explore in more detail here: `Yampa`, `netwire`, `reactive-banana`, and
`sodium`.

reactive-banana
---------------

Notes: Heinrich Apfelmus, applicative-based, events and behaviours

sodium
------

Notes: Stephen Blackheath, applicative-based, monadic reactives

netwire
-------

Notes: Ertugrul Soeylemez, arrow-based

Yampa
-----

Notes: Henrik Nilsson, Antony Courtney, George Giorgidze, arrow-based

Elerea
------

Notes: Patai Gergely, no signals

Reactive
